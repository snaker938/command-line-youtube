This is a mini version of YouTube. It is in the form of a command line interface (for now) and is entirely written in python.

It was built during my three month virtual internship at Bright Netowork. 

Drag and drop the zipped folder to another folder titled anything e.g command-line-youtube
Unzip the folder
Delete the zipped folder

To run the program, please run these commands in the file prompt:

cd {your-main-file, e.g command-line-youtube}
python3 -m src.run



And there you go!
If that does not work, try with and without "python3" or run the "run" file the usual way that you do!

Please note: the command "delete_video" currently doesnt work, even tho it says it does. This is a known bug. It may be fixed!
